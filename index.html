      <h3>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I drew 5 portraits in 2 weeks.</p>
        <p>One day I made 120 calls in one day with, 15 requests for quotes, and 3 sales from that day that resulted in
          $520,000 in sales.</p>
      </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Three Qualitative Accomplishments:</h3>
    </div>
      <div>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I am a fast learner if I am fully immersed in what it is I must learn</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> My last employer did not give me the time or resources to become fully familiar with <br>
          a software app and I struggled at work because I was not immersed.</p>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I honestly pay a lot of attention to detail.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> I will get stuck on something because I am paying too much attention.</p>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I have great intuition.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> Sometimes my intuition holds me back from creating something great.</p>
    </div>
    <p><h3>Passion Project</h3></p>
    <div>
      <p>When I create graffiti it begins with a balance of qualitative and quantitative qualities working together to create an image in my mind to replicate onto paper. When I’m
        relaying the information onto the sketch pad, logic and spatial reasoning come into play and clash with creativity to create something unimaginable
        but realistic. My art has to be realistic enough that it could actually exist in reality but chaotic enough to make one believe that anything could be real.</p>
    </div>
    <p><h3>PURPOSE</h3></p>
    <img src="goldencircle.png" alt="goldencircle"/>
    <p><b>Elevator Pitch</b></p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> New career with realistic potential and opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
    <p><b>How:</b> By finding or creating a web development position that challenges me to keep learning and helping people.</p>
    <p><b>What:</b> Creating efficent and effective websites to promote myself as a developer.</p>
    <p> I want to I want to be able to provide for my family while doing what I love. By that I mean that most jobs do not challenge <br>
       or allow growth as an individual, only as an employee with “advancements”. I want to be able to solve real world problems, my most <br>
      recent position, many of my coworkers and myself were struggling to learn the dated customer service software. Were you ever in that position?</p>

<p><h3>Weekly Reflection (Week I)</h3>
This week I learned so much, more than I have known about web development and
about my capabilities. I became aware that I am learning faster when I am able to follow along, very much like a tutorial.
I am a bit intimidated by the work I have already and feel as if I have walked into a wall of new information. But every
task I complete gives me a bit of motivation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><h3>weekly Reflection (Week II)</h3>
  This past week was somewhat easier than last week, I understood a few more concepts and a lot more terminology. <br>
  So I wasn't as intimidated as last week when I knew next to nothing. Everything is starting to gradually make <br>
  sense throughout the course of each week. OOP is becoming a little easier to understand with each new term and concept<br>
  introduced but I can't wait to go forth and ask my tutor, Jude, a million questions. I feel like I know what to do during <br>
  the Snap Challenges in the morning but I don't know exactly how to do it.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><h3>Weekly Reflection III</h3></p>
  <p> This week was a blur, we were invited to the Digital Media's first graduation, it was exciting to see their projects <br>
    and to see the amount of material they learned. Personally, I do feel as if I have learned and retained a thing over the <br>
    past week. It all went by too quick. I would like to know exactly what I'm doing with PDO statements. I think I'm not <br>
    getting the full understanding because I chose a poor website to use, which is wikileaks. Having never used it myself, it <br>
    was defintely a challenge to dissect. I do hope next week is a little smoother for me because I truly feel lost.</p>
  <p><h3>Reflection for Game Day</h3></p>
  <p>Today we played Forbidden Island with our Capstone Teams. It was a lot of fun, I felt and feel comfortable with the team <br>
  I'm on. We got off to a rocky start because we misunderstood the instructions and thought we had to increase our flood cards <br>
  after each players' turn. I feel like I knew that was incorrect and failed to ask for clarification on the instructions. So <br>
  it was sort of like, we each interpreted the rules in our own ways. A little more discussion or questions answered would've <br>
  that issue. And of course, I have come to terms with the fact that I DO NOT ask for help or clarification when I should be. <br>
  That is something I need to worl on and it should've been listed as a weakness of mine. Instead, I waste time searching for <br>
  answers on my own. All in all, I know we are going to win the next time we decide to play because we did a great job planning <br>
  and communicating our goals during the course of the game and we did not leave out any of our team members. Even Rae and I had <br>
  to double up and play as one player becuase the maximum amount of players is 4. We will work great as team.</p>
