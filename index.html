<strong>Quantitative Accomplishments</strong>
<p>I drew 5 portraits in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>One day I made 120 calls in one day with, 15 requests for quotes, and 3 sales from that day that resulted in
$520,000 in sales.</p>

<p><strong>Three Qualitative Accomplishments</p></strong>

<p><strong>Strength:</p></strong>
<p>I am a fast learner if I am fully immersed in what it is I must learn</p>
Weakness:
<p>My last employer did not give me the time or resources to become fully familiar with
a software app and I struggled at work because I was not immersed.</p>

<p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
<p>I honestly pay a lot of attention to detail</p>

<p><strong>Weakness</strong>
I will get stuck on something because I am paying too much attention</p>

<p>I have great intuition
Sometimes my intuition holds me back from creating something great</p>

<p><strong>Passion Project</strong>
When I create graffiti it begins with a balance of qualitative and quantitative qualities working together to create an image in my mind to replicate onto paper. When Iâ€™m
relaying the information onto the sketch pad, logic and spatial reasoning come into play and clash with creativity to create something unimaginable
but realistic. My art has to be realistic enough that it could actually exist in reality but chaotic enough to make one believe that anything could be real.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Reflection (Week I)</strong>
This week I learned so much, more than I have known about web development and
about my capabilities. I became aware that I am learning faster when I am able to follow along, very much like a tutorial.
I am a bit intimidated by the work I have already and feel as if I have walked into a wall of new information. But every
task I complete gives me a bit of motivation.</p>
