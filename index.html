      <h3>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h3>
      <section>
        <p>I drew 5 portraits in 2 weeks.</p>
        <p>One day I made 120 calls in one day with, 15 requests for quotes, and 3 sales from that day that resulted in
          $520,000 in sales.</p>

      <h3>Three Qualitative Accomplishments:</h3>
      <section>
      <p><b>Strength:</b></p>
        <p>I am a fast learner if I am fully immersed in what it is I must learn</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b></p>
        <p>My last employer did not give me the time or resources to become fully familiar with <br>
          a software app and I struggled at work because I was not immersed.</p>
      <p><b><Strength</b></p>
        <p>I honestly pay a lot of attention to detail.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness</b></p>
        <p>I will get stuck on something because I am paying too much attention</p>
      <p><b>Strength</b></p>
        <p>I have great intuition</p>
      <p><b>Weakness</b></p>
        <p>Sometimes my intuition holds me back from creating something great</p>

    <p><h3>Passion Project</h3></p>
    <section>
      <p>When I create graffiti it begins with a balance of qualitative and quantitative qualities working together to create an image in my mind to replicate onto paper. When Iâ€™m
        relaying the information onto the sketch pad, logic and spatial reasoning come into play and clash with creativity to create something unimaginable
        but realistic. My art has to be realistic enough that it could actually exist in reality but chaotic enough to make one believe that anything could be real.</p>

<p><h3>Weekly Reflection (Week I)</h3>
This week I learned so much, more than I have known about web development and
about my capabilities. I became aware that I am learning faster when I am able to follow along, very much like a tutorial.
I am a bit intimidated by the work I have already and feel as if I have walked into a wall of new information. But every
task I complete gives me a bit of motivation.</p>

<p><h3>weekly Reflection (Week II)</h3>
  This past week was somewhat easier than last week, I understood a few more concepts and a lot more terminology. <br>
  So I wasn't as intimidated as last week when I knew next to nothing. Everything is starting to gradually make <br>
  sense throughout the course of each week. OOP is becoming a little easier to understand with each new term and concept<br>
  introduced but I can't wait to go forth and ask my tutor, Jude, a million questions.
