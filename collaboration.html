      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p><h3>Reflection for Game Day</h3></p>
      <p>Today we played Forbidden Island with our Capstone Teams. It was a lot of fun, I felt and feel comfortable with the team <br>
        I'm on. We got off to a rocky start because we misunderstood the instructions and thought we had to increase our flood cards <br>
        after each players' turn. I feel like I knew that was incorrect and failed to ask for clarification on the instructions. So <br>
        it was sort of like, we each interpreted the rules in our own ways. A little more discussion or questions answered would've <br>
        that issue. And of course, I have come to terms with the fact that I DO NOT ask for help or clarification when I should be. <br>
        That is something I need to worl on and it should've been listed as a weakness of mine. Instead, I waste time searching for <br>
        answers on my own. All in all, I know we are going to win the next time we decide to play because we did a great job planning <br>
        and communicating our goals during the course of the game and we did not leave out any of our team members. Even Rae and I had <br>
        to double up and play as one player becuase the maximum amount of players is 4. We will work great as team.</p>
