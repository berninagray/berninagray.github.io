    <p><h3>Whole Brain - Passion Project</h3></p>
    <div>
      <p>When I create graffiti it begins with a balance of qualitative and quantitative qualities working together to create an image in my mind to replicate onto paper. <br>
         When I’m relaying the information onto the sketch pad, logic and spatial reasoning come into play and clash with creativity to create something unimaginable <br>
        but realistic. My art has to be realistic enough that it could actually exist in reality but chaotic enough to make one believe that anything could be real.</p>

    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
    <p><b>Why:</b>Using </p>
    <p><b>How:</b> By finding or creating a web development position that challenges me to keep learning and helping people.</p>
    <p><b>What:</b> Creating efficient and effective websites to promote myself as a developer and employee.</p>
    <p> I want to I want to be able to provide for my family while doing what I love. By that I mean that most jobs do not challenge <br>

            <p><h3>Weekly Reflection (Week I)</h3>
            This week I learned so much, more than I have known about web development and
            about my capabilities. I became aware that I am learning faster when I am able to follow along, <br>
            very much like a tutorial. I am a bit intimidated by the work I have already and feel as if I have <br>
            walked into a wall of new information. But every task I complete gives me a bit of motivation. <br>
            I am exicted, scared and looking forward to this challenge!</p>
