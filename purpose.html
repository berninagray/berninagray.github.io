      <h3>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I drew 5 portraits in 2 weeks.</li>
          <li>I made 120 calls in one day with, 15 requests for quotes, and 3 sales from that day that resulted in
          $520,000 in sales.</li>
        <div class="containerList">
      <h3>Three Qualitative Accomplishments:</h3>
          <li>Maintained a call quality of 95% or higher</li>
      <div>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I am a fast learner if I am fully immersed in what it is I must learn</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> My last employer did not give me the time or resources to become fully familiar with <br>
          a software app and I struggled at work because I was not immersed.</p>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I honestly pay a lot of attention to detail.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> I will get stuck on something because I am paying too much attention.</p>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I have great intuition.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> Sometimes my intuition holds me back from creating something great.</p>

    <p><h3>Passion Project</h3></p>
    <div>
      <p>When I create graffiti it begins with a balance of qualitative and quantitative qualities working together to create an image in my mind to replicate onto paper. When I’m
        relaying the information onto the sketch pad, logic and spatial reasoning come into play and clash with creativity to create something unimaginable
        but realistic. My art has to be realistic enough that it could actually exist in reality but chaotic enough to make one believe that anything could be real.</p>

    <p><b>Elevator Pitch</b></p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> New career with realistic potential and opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
    <p><b>How:</b> By finding or creating a web development position that challenges me to keep learning and helping people.</p>
    <p><b>What:</b> Creating efficent and effective websites to promote myself as a developer.</p>
    <p> I want to I want to be able to provide for my family while doing what I love. By that I mean that most jobs do not challenge <br>
       or allow growth as an individual, only as an employee with “advancements”. I want to be able to solve real world problems, my most <br>
      recent position, many of my coworkers and myself were struggling to learn the dated customer service software. Were you ever in that position?</p>
           <div>
<p><h3>Weekly Reflection (Week I)</h3>
This week I learned so much, more than I have known about web development and
about my capabilities. I became aware that I am learning faster when I am able to follow along, very much like a tutorial.
I am a bit intimidated by the work I have already and feel as if I have walked into a wall of new information. But every
task I complete gives me a bit of motivation.</p>
