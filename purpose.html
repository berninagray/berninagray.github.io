      <p><b>Strength:</b> I am a fast learner if I am fully immersed in what it is I must learn</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> My last employer did not give me the time or resources to become fully familiar with <br>
          a software app and I struggled at work because I was not immersed.</p>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I honestly pay a lot of attention to detail.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> I will get stuck on something because I am paying too much attention.</p>
      <p><b>Strength:</b> I have great intuition.</p>
      <p><b>Weakness:</b> Sometimes my intuition holds me back from creating something great.</p>

    <p><h3>Passion Project</h3></p>
    <div>
      <p>When I create graffiti it begins with a balance of qualitative and quantitative qualities working together to create an image in my mind to replicate onto paper. <br>
         When I’m relaying the information onto the sketch pad, logic and spatial reasoning come into play and clash with creativity to create something unimaginable <br>
        but realistic. My art has to be realistic enough that it could actually exist in reality but chaotic enough to make one believe that anything could be real.</p>

    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
    <p><b>Why:</b> New career with realistic potential and opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
    <p><b>How:</b> By finding or creating a web development position that challenges me to keep learning and helping people.</p>
    <p><b>What:</b> Creating efficent and effective websites to promote myself as a developer.</p>
    <p> I want to I want to be able to provide for my family while doing what I love. By that I mean that most jobs do not challenge <br>
       or allow growth as an individual, only as an employee with “advancements”. I want to be able to solve real world problems, my most <br>
      recent position, many of my coworkers and myself were struggling to learn the dated customer service software. Were you ever in that position?</p>

<p><h3>Weekly Reflection (Week I)</h3>
This week I learned so much, more than I have known about web development and
about my capabilities. I became aware that I am learning faster when I am able to follow along, very much like a tutorial.
I am a bit intimidated by the work I have already and feel as if I have walked into a wall of new information. But every
task I complete gives me a bit of motivation.</p>
