      <h2>Identity Framing</h2>
      <p><h3>weekly Reflection (Week II)</h3>
      This past week was somewhat easier than last week, I understood a few more concepts and a lot more terminology. <br>
      So I wasn't as intimidated as last week when I knew next to nothing. Everything is starting to gradually make <br>
      sense throughout the course of each week. OOP is becoming a little easier to understand with each new term and concept<br>
      introduced but I can't wait to go forth and ask my tutor, Jude, a million questions. I feel like I know what to do during <br>
      the Snap Challenges in the morning but I don't know exactly how to do it.</p>
