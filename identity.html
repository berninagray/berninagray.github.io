        <p>The photo on the left represents my feelings towards previous positions I've held at work. I was at the beach, or at my job, <br>
          making money and although I'm ok and am enjoying myself, I'm still feeling like there's something better for me. Therefore, I'm the <br>
          person looking outward toward the water instead of working on the sandcastle.</p>
        <p>The second image is me after bootcamp, I see myself leading others and helping them at their current jobs, making their workflwo easier <br>
          and manageable, whether it be with the current software or websites they're using or new ones that we're creating and implementing.</p>

      <p><h3>Weekly Reflection (Week II)</h3>
      This past week was somewhat easier than last week, I understood a few more concepts and a lot more terminology, especially about <br>
      OOP. I am pretty comfortable writing personas but would like to focuse more on data design and constructing conceptual models and <br>
      breaking up the data presented into entitites and then into attributes. I am more comfortable with the back-end rather than front-end work.<br>
      So I wasn't as intimidated as last week when I knew next to nothing. Everything is starting to gradually make <br>
      sense throughout the course of each week. OOP is becoming a little easier to understand with each new term and concept<br>
      introduced but I can't wait to go forth and ask my tutor, Jude, a million questions. I feel like I know what to do during <br>
      the Snap Challenges in the morning but I don't know exactly how to do it.</p>
