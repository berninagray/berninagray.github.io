      <h3>Weekly Reflection (Week III)</h3>
      <p>This week we finished up our Data Design project. I feel as if I just customized my assert statements <br>
      from the Data Design project on Twitter. The only challenge I kept facing was that I didn't have as many Classes <br>
    or Attributes as the Twitter reference so I kept getting confused. But I still love Data Design as mcu has I did before.</p>
