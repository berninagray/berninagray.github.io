        <p> This week was a blur, we were invited to the Digital Media's first graduation, it was exciting to see their projects <br>
          and to see the amount of material they learned. Personally, I do feel as if I have learned and retained a thing over the <br>
          past week. It all went by too quick. I would like to know exactly what I'm doing with PDO statements. I think I'm not <br>
          getting the full understanding because I chose a poor website to use, which is wikileaks. Having never used it myself, it <br>
          was defintely a challenge to dissect. I do hope next week is a little smoother for me because I truly feel lost.</p>
